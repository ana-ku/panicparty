Butterfly Collector: "Ah, perfect timing! I don’t think I’ve shared the wonders of my butterfly collection with you yet!"
- Sorry, I have to go
	Butterfly Collector: "To hunt butterflies? Maybe... social butterflies, hahaha."
	- "No, I really need to leave right now."
		Butterfly Collector: "Leave? But what could possibly be more important than butterflies? Surely you’re joking!"
		(He crosses his arms, blocking your path and waiting for an explanation.)
		- Moths are planning a coup!
			Butterfly Collector: "A coup? Against butterflies?! This is a disaster! Go, defend them! Quickly!"  
			(He steps aside, and you make your escape.)
		- Please, just let me go.
			Butterfly Collector: "Hm... Butterflies do value freedom. Fine, go. But come back later!"  
			(He steps aside, and you make your escape.)
	- Yes! Hunt butterflies!
		Butterfly Collector: "Why, may I ask?"
		- I love them!
			Butterfly Collector: "Aha, a true butterfly admirer! Go, then, and enjoy their beauty!"  
			(He steps aside, clearly pleased, and you slip away.)
		- I want to annihilate them!
			Butterfly Collector: "Annihilate them? That’s absurd! Butterflies are the essence of beauty and life itself!"  
			(He begins pacing, passionately defending butterflies.)
			- "Okay, I don’t want to annihilate butterflies anymore."
				Butterfly Collector: "Ah, a change of heart! How wonderful! Go now, and spread the word of their magnificence!"  
				(He steps aside, letting you leave.)
			- "I heard the host of this party put butterflies in the mini burgers."
				Butterfly Collector: "WHAT?! That monster! I must confront them immediately!"  
				(He storms off, leaving you free to escape.)
- Wouldn’t you rather have punch than talk to me?
	Butterfly Collector: "Oh no, not really. I was too busy thinking about butterflies. But now that you mention it, the punch reminds me of the crimson red of the Scarlet Mormon butterfly..."
	(The conversation drags on, and you start regretting life decisions.)
	- "Wow, that’s so interesting! Tell me more about the Scarlet... Mormon butterfly."
		Butterfly Collector: "Oh, I’m glad you’re interested! Did you know it’s named after missionary movements? Its vibrant red symbolizes their passion! Hahahahaha."  
		(While he laughs and gets lost in explaining more butterfly trivia, you quietly step away, making your escape.)
	- "I think someone spilled punch on the Scarlet Tablecloth Butterfly!"
		Butterfly Collector: "Spilled punch? That’s horrifying! But wait—there’s no such thing as a Scarlet Tablecloth Butterfly... or is there?!"  
		(He starts flipping through his butterfly notes in confusion, giving you just enough time to slip away unnoticed.)
	- Butterflies can be red?
		Butterfly Collector: Oh, my dear friend, you have so much to learn! Let me show you something."  
		(He starts pointing to objects to explain butterfly colors.)
		- Look, that vase over there! It reminds me of a butterfly too.
			Butterfly Collector: "Yes, exactly! You’re starting to see the beauty of it now!"  
			(While he focuses on the vase, you quietly escape to the bathroom.)
		- I need to go while you’re not looking!
			Butterfly Collector: "Ah, wait! You can’t leave yet. I haven’t even shown you my butterfly photos!"  
			(He starts to looking for his phone, but you managed to run away..)
- Behind you!
	Butterfly Collector: "What?"
	- Just point and scream.
		(He turns around, and you use the moment to escape.)
	- A moth!
		Butterfly Collector: "Where? I must destroy it!"  
		(He turns around, giving you the perfect chance to escape.)
	- A butterfly!
		Butterfly Collector: "Butterflies are sleeping. Did they not teach you that in school? When I was your age..."  
		(The torment of his lecture is long and painful, and you grow to hate butterflies.)
		- Can I go now?
			Butterfly Collector: "Where would you go? I have pictures of butterflies on my phone. Give me a minute!"  
			- Run.
				(You successfully run away. You will never see butterfly in your life.)
			- Wait.
				(You politely wait, but you regret it. This guy has 128 GB of butterfly photos.)
				- Accuse one photo of being moth
					(He is alarmed by your claim and immidietaly deletes the photo. He cannot look you in the eyes, not now. You take your leave.)
				- Make secret alliance with moth devil to save you.
					(Moths are wild creatures, but always honor their word. Words cannot describe what happened next. But you can go, souless but free.)
		- I once caught a butterfly with a spoon!
			Butterfly Collector: "A spoon? Amateur! I once caught a Swallowtail blindfolded, standing on one leg during a thunderstorm."  
			(He begins an epic tale of his adventures, trapping you in butterfly hell.)
			- That’s impressive! Tell me more.
				Butterfly Collector: "Ah, now you understand the craft. Sit down. I’ll tell you everything!"  
				(It turned out that he doesn´t need someone to talk with about butterflies. He will manage whole conversation while you sneak away.)
			- Oh yeah? I wrestled a Moth King once.
				Butterfly Collector: "The Moth King?! Impossible! "  
				(He bows in respect as you casually walk away.)
		- I just ate one of your butterflies!
			Butterfly Collector: "WHAT?! YOU ATE A BUTTERFLY?!"  
			(He pales, gags, and rushes to vomit. You bolt for freedom.)
