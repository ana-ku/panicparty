(You tried to escape this infernal mingle when an eccentric painter grabbed you by your arm.)
Painter: "Hello, I need your advice on my newest project!"
- Quit your job and go back to college!
	(You shouted at him. He looks thunderstruck! You might have won this situation!)
	Painter: "Wow... nobody... you... You are my muse, and I must paint you!"
	(Damn...)
	- I don’t want to be your muse!
		Painter: "Yes, exactly! I want a muse who does not want me back!"
		- Okay, but you will pay me.
			Painter: "What?! Never! A true muse will reject me for free!"
			(He angrily started making doodles in his notepad. You managed to sneak away.)
		- Go and paint me elsewhere!
			Painter: "Where?! Where should I paint you, muse?"
			- In the kitchen.
				Painter: "Oh yes! You could be the portrait of a 1950s housewife with post-apocalyptic clothes! But instead of a shirt, you will have..."
				(You will never know what you would have, because you escaped with your shirt.)
			- In the basement.
				Painter: "Brilliant! I want to kiss you for that! You know, I once had a beautiful muse in my basement..."
				(He stopped talking, looked around, and started to sweat. You will never talk about his secret, and he will never talk to you again.)
			- In the bedroom.
				Painter: "Oooh, kinky!"
				- Not like that!
					Painter: *(Sadly.)* "Oh... well... I should find another muse then!"
					(He left you. You feel bad for his next muse.)
				- Exactly!
					Painter: *(He blushes and rushes to the bedroom. You are lucky, as the bedroom is not near the toilets.)*
	- I have never been a muse!
		Painter: "Me neither! We have so much in common!"
		- "I have standards, you know."  
			Painter: (Raises an eyebrow, clearly intrigued.)  
			"Standards? Fascinating! Let me guess—you’ll only pose if there’s a chandelier, a fog machine, and perhaps... a live peacock?"  
			(They look at you eagerly, waiting for your demands.)  
			- "Exactly, add a golden throne too."  
				Painter: (Laughs maniacally.)  
				"Yes! A golden throne! Oh, this will be the most extravagant portrait the world has ever seen!"  
				(They wander off to gather supplies, leaving you free to escape.)  
			- "Actually, I just want to be left alone."  
				Painter: (Sighs dramatically, putting down their sketchbook.)  
				"Alone? Why you did not tell me that earlier? That’s such a shame. You have the perfect energy for a masterpiece."  
				(They reluctantly step aside, letting you leave.)
		- "Sure, but only if I can pose in the bathroom for two hours alone."  
			Painter: (Pauses, tilting their head thoughtfully.)  
			"In the bathroom? Intriguing. A statement on privacy and vulnerability, perhaps? Yes, yes, I can see it now! Go my beautfil muse!"  
			(They start muttering about metaphors, giving you the perfect chance to slip away unnoticed.)  
	- Can I be your muse after a bathroom break?
		Painter: "No breaks! We have to paint now!"
		- I AM GOING TO THE BATHROOM!
			Painter: "Yes, that’s the energy! The emotions! You are perfect!"
			(What a dick.)
			- Kick him PERFECTLY
				(With the sound of the smallest violence, you escape from him. Ouch.)
			- Try to run away from him
				(You turn and make a run for it, hoping he won’t follow. Luckily, you’re right, and you get away.)
			- I will BREAK you!
				Painter: "Yes, that’s the energy! The emotions! You are perfect!"
				(He’s so astounded by your intensity that he doesn’t even try to stop you as you walk away.)
- Just paint nude.
	Painter: "What a brilliant idea! But who should be nude, me or my muse?"
	- You should be nude.
		Painter: *(Pauses, looking thoughtful.)* "Of course! The ultimate expression of vulnerability and artistry!"
		(He rushes off to prepare, leaving you free to escape.)
	- She should be nude.
		Painter: *(Grins mischievously.)* "Ah, a classic choice! But would she be willing? Let us ask!"
		(He beckons for someone, clearly preparing for a long-winded discussion.)
		- Suggest she holds a pineapple.
			Painter: *(Stops mid-sentence, utterly perplexed.)* "A pineapple? That’s... absurd. But perhaps genius!"
			(He rushes off to find a pineapple, giving you the perfect opportunity to disappear.)
		- Ask if she can paint herself.
			Painter: *(Gasps with delight.)* "A self-portrait! A collaboration between muse and master! This will redefine art!"
			(He pulls you into a chaotic discussion about logistics, trapping you for artistic eternity, until he loses his motivation, as every artist does after two minutes.)
			- You know, Van Gogh once painted himself without an ear.
				Painter: *(Stops mid-sentence, visibly shaken.)* "Without an ear? Fascinating! I must research this immediately!"
				(He rushes off to gather references, forgetting entirely about you.)
			- Maybe it would be better as a performance piece.
				Painter: *(His eyes widen with realization.)* "Of course! Live art! The ultimate medium!"
				(He grabs a paintbrush and starts performing to an imaginary audience, allowing you to quietly slip away.)
	- Why not both?
		Painter: *(His eyes widen with excitement.)* "Genius! A bold commentary on duality and balance. I must begin sketching immediately!"
		(He begins drafting a plan, clearly expecting you to stay involved.)
		- Suggest she holds a pineapple.
			Painter: *(Stops mid-sentence, utterly perplexed.)* "A pineapple? That’s... absurd. But perhaps genius!"
			(He rushes off to find a pineapple, giving you the perfect opportunity to disappear.)

- My favorite painter is Leonardo DiCaprio.
	Painter: "And your favorite actor is Leonardo da Vinci, right? The youth is truly hopeless these days!"
	*(Shaking his head in utter disappointment, he mutters something about the decline of art and storms off, leaving you blissfully alone. You have successfully escaped.)*
