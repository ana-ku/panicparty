~ Nun
(A serene-looking nun in a perfectly pressed habit appears beside you, holding a prayer book. Her calm smile is almost unnerving, and her gaze feels as though she can see right through you.)

Nun: "Good evening, my child. Are you finding peace and purpose in this gathering of lost souls?"
- I need to go to the bathroom.
	Nun: (Nods sagely, flipping through her prayer book.)  
	"Ah, as it is written in Ecclesiastes 3:1, 'To everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven.' Tell me, child—do you need to go number one or number two?"  
	- Number one.
		Nun: (Closes her book with a soft smile.)  "Go, then, and be swift. The Lord frowns upon lingering in unholy places."  
		(She steps aside, allowing you to leave.)  
	- Number two.
		Nun: (Closes her book with a solemn nod.)  "May your burdens be light, and your aim true. Go in peace, child."  
		(She steps aside, allowing you to leave.)  
	- I’m not going to tell you that.
		Nun: (Smiles slightly, tilting her head in curiosity.)  "Ah, a secretive one. Very well, then. But secrets weigh upon the soul, you know. Tell me, child, is there something deeper troubling you?"  
		(She subtly shifts the topic, leading to further conversation about your "spiritual burdens.") 
		- Because it’s a mystery even to me.
			Nun: (Her smile widens as if she’s heard the greatest confession of the night.)  "A mystery, indeed. The greatest burdens are often those we don’t fully understand ourselves."  
			Nun: (She gently pats your shoulder.) "Go and seek your answers, child. I’ll be here if the mystery ever unravels."  
			(She steps aside, letting you leave with a mixture of amusement and pity.)  
		- What if I told you it’s none of your business?
			Nun: (She sighs deeply, clutching her prayer book to her chest.)  "Ah, such defiance, yet I see the struggle in your eyes. Very well, if it must remain your secret burden, I shall not press further."  (She pauses, her expression softening slightly.)  
			"But truly, child, between us—are we speaking of number one or number two?"  
			- Number one.
				Nun: (Nods with a serene smile.)  "Go, then, and be swift. May the Lord guide you in haste."  
				(She steps aside, allowing you to leave.)  
			- Number two.
				Nun: (Her expression grows solemn, and she places a hand over her heart.)  "May your burdens be light, and your aim true. Go in peace, child."  
				(She steps aside, allowing you to leave.)  
		- I just don’t trust nuns who quote Bible verses about bathrooms.
			Nun: (Laughs softly but steps closer, lowering her voice conspiratorially.)  "Smart, child. Never trust anyone who quotes Ecclesiastes near the loo. I will pray for you."  
			(She lets you go with a glimmer of amusement in her eyes.)  
- Is that Archangel Michael over there?
	Nun: (Her serene expression doesn’t falter as she looks toward where you’re pointing.)  "Archangel Michael? A fascinating claim. But tell me, child—how many eyes does he have?"  
	- Two?
		Nun: (Shakes her head, disappointed.)  "Only two? Such mortal limitations. Perhaps you need to reflect on the true form of heavenly beings."  
		(She pulls you into a theological discussion about biblical angelic forms, and you are trapped.)  
		- I am sure he has two!
			Nun: (Her smile fades slightly, replaced with a look of mild disappointment.)  "Two eyes? Oh, child, such naivety. Clearly, you are in desperate need of religious instruction. Allow me to guide you."  
			(She opens a small prayer book and gestures for you to listen attentively.)  
			- I’m actually late for a lesson.  
				Nun: (Nods approvingly.)  "Ah, a diligent student already on the path of learning. Very well, I won’t keep you. May your journey be blessed."  
				(She steps aside, letting you leave.)  
			- I’m not interested in any lessons.  
				Nun: (Her eyes narrow, and her tone grows stern.)  "Not interested? Ignorance is a dangerous path, child. Sit down, and I will enlighten you."  
				(She begins reciting passages from Ezekiel, trapping you in an exhaustive theological lecture about angelic forms and divine mysteries.)  
				- Shout, "I need an angel shot!"  
					Nun: (Her eyes widen in shock, and she immediately steps back.)  "An angel shot? Oh dear, I didn’t realize the danger you were in. Go, child, and seek safety!"  
					(She makes the sign of the cross and hurriedly walks away, leaving you free to escape.)  
				- Threaten her with nun-chucks.  
					Nun: (Her serene expression turns to utter confusion, then panic.)  "Nun-chucks?! A weapon with my very name?! Such sacrilege!"  
					(She clutches her prayer book tightly and steps back in terror.)  "Fine, child, go and swing your unholy weapon elsewhere! May the Lord forgive your terrible pun."  
					(She retreats quickly, leaving you free to slip away.)  
		- I did not say he has only two, but he has at least two eyes.
			Nun: (She is struck. You were technically correct, which is the best kind of correct.)  "I... I... Lord forgive me."  
			(You defeated the nun. Are you proud? No. Are you free to go? Hell yes!)  
		- I was wrong, okay?!
			Nun: "I forgive you, child, for your stupidity is not your fault."  
			- Thank you for forgiveness.
				Nun: (Her serene smile softens.)  "Forgiveness is the path to salvation, child. Go forth and seek the light in all you do."  
				(She bows her head slightly and steps aside.)  
			- (Be silent)
				Nun: (The nun gazes directly at you, her expression calm but unyielding. The silence stretches on, becoming heavier and more awkward with every second.)  
				=> Thankyou  
	- Many?
		Nun: (Smiles knowingly.)  "Ah, yes. Eyes upon eyes, as Ezekiel described. But don’t let your curiosity lead you astray."  
		(She lets you go, her expression suggesting she knows more than she’s letting on.)  
	- None.
		Nun: (Pauses, her smile fading slightly.)  "None? A bold and heretical claim, child. Do you think such beings are beyond sight, or is this simply ignorance?"  
		(She looks deeply intrigued, clearly not letting you leave just yet as she presses for an explanation.)  
		- I don’t see eyes. I am actually blind.
			Nun: (Her eyebrows lift in surprise, and she chuckles softly.)  "Blindness is your gift? Interesting. Perhaps faith truly does guide the hand more than sight."  
			(She steps aside, amused by your strange logic, allowing you to leave.)  
		- I just wanted to mess with you.
			Nun: (She lets out a long sigh and places her hands together as if in prayer.)  "Messing with a nun? Truly, the devil works in mysterious ways."  
			(She shakes her head, stepping aside.)  "Go, child, before I reconsider my patience with you."  
- I actually worship hell.
	Nun: (Looks around and leans towards you.)  "Well, don’t we all?"  (She winks and presses a finger to her lips, motioning for silence.)  
	(You now realize that this nun has secrets of her own. She steps aside, letting you pass with an amused glint in her eyes.)  
	=> END
