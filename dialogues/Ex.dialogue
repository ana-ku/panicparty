~ expartner  
(Suddenly, you feel a dangerous snake wrapping around you. Not literally, of course—just your Ex. Their grip on your attention is as unrelenting as ever.)  
Ex: "Oh my gosh, is that really you? It’s been ages! You look... amazing. We should talk. We have so much to catch up on."  
- "I don’t know who you are."  
	Ex: (Their smile doesn’t falter, but their eyes narrow slightly.)  "Of course you don’t. Because I’m a different person now! I’ve changed for you. I don’t even stop people at parties who are just trying to go to the bathroom anymore!"  
	Ex: (They pause for dramatic effect, their voice softening.)  "But can’t you see? I’m doing better—because of you."  
	(They step closer, their gaze locking on yours, making it clear you’re not leaving yet.)  
	- "Still don’t know who you are."  
		Ex: (They take a step back, their smile finally cracking.)  "Wow. Just... wow. After everything? You really don’t remember me?"  
		(Their shoulders drop, and they sigh dramatically.)  
		- "Maybe you should remind me?"  
			Ex: (Their face lights up with sudden enthusiasm as they drop to one knee, pulling out a ring box.)  "Of course! Let me remind you... of how perfect we were together. This ring will say it all."  
			Ex: (They open the box with a flourish, their eyes sparkling with over-the-top sincerity.)  "Marry me, and you’ll never forget me again."  => marry  
		- "Sorry, but I really don’t."  
			Ex: (They let out an exaggerated gasp, clutching their chest as if you’ve just stabbed them.)  "You don’t? Oh, I’ll make sure you *never* forget me."  
			(They dramatically kneel, holding up a ring box.) "Marry me. Then we’ll create new memories that will last forever."  => marry  
	- "You must mistake me for someone else."  
		Ex: (Grins, pulling out a velvet box and dropping to one knee with theatrical flair.)  "Mistake? Never. I know it’s you. And I have proof." 
		(They open the box, revealing an overly shiny ring next to your kindergarten photo, their eyes gleaming with overconfidence.)  "Marry me. You know it’s meant to be."  => marry  
- "I can’t right now."  
	Ex: (Their expression shifts, and they look at you with wide, puppy-dog eyes. For a moment, your knees feel weak — wait, no. Not your knees. Your clenched fists.)  
	"Oh, you’re busy? Like I wasn’t busy when I spent hours thinking about us? But fine, I get it. I’ll be quick then."  
	Ex: (Without hesitation, they drop to one knee, pulling out a small velvet box with dramatic flair.) "Marry me. Then you’ll *never* be too busy for us again."  => marry  
- "We haven’t dated since kindergarten."  
	Ex: (Laughs nervously, clearly trying to cover their embarrassment.)  
	"Kindergarten? Well, yeah, but we had a connection! Remember snack time? Sharing crayons? That stuff meant something!"  
	- "Sharing crayons doesn’t count as dating."  
		Ex: (Gasps dramatically, clutching their chest.) "It *absolutely* counts! Do you know how personal sharing crayons is at that age?!"  
		(They drop to one knee, pulling out a ring box.) "Let’s make it official this time. Marry me."  => marry  
	- "Fine. Let’s call it love."  
		Ex: (Their face lights up with excitement, as if they’ve just won a prize.) "Exactly! You get it! Love transcends time, and ours started early."  
		(Without missing a beat, they kneel, presenting a ring.) "Let’s pick up where we left off. Marry me."  => marry  
	- "I also destroyed your sandcastle."  
		Ex: (Ex starts to laugh.) "That’s right! And everyone knows that when someone destroys a man’s castle, it’s the greenest flag of all time."  
		- "You’re a giant red flag."  
			Ex: (Grins mischievously and immediately drops to one knee, pulling out a ring box.) "Red flag? Maybe. But imagine how *romantic* our story will sound. 'My green flag love married me, a red flag!' Together, we’ll become the Bangladesh flag."  => marry  
		- "And you never destroyed my castle!"  
			Ex: (Gasps dramatically, clutching their chest as if wounded.)  "Never? Oh, I must correct that. But first..."  
			(They kneel theatrically, opening a ring box.) "Let’s build new castles together—on the foundation of true love. Marry me."  => marry  
=> END  

~ marry  
- "What?! No!"  
	Ex: (Closes the box with an exaggerated sigh, standing up slowly.)  "Fine. Play hard to get. This isn’t over."  
	(They step aside, watching you leave with a knowing smile, as if planning your next meeting.)  
- "This is insane. I’m leaving."  
	Ex: (Still on one knee, shouting after you.)  "Run all you want, but we both know I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to you!"  
	(They finally stand up, dusting themselves off with mock dignity, and walk away with a dramatic flip of their coat.)  
- "Never."  
	Ex: (Their smile fades, and their voice drops to a chilling tone as thunder booms in the distance.)  "Oh, you think you have a choice?"  
	Ex: (They slowly rise, the dramatic lighting making them look like a villain in a gothic romance.)  "You’ll see, my love. One day, you’ll say yes. And it will be glorious."  
	(As lightning flashes, they turn and walk into the shadows, leaving you shaken but free to go.)
