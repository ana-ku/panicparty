(A woman in all black with a microphone clipped to her collar suddenly appears at your side. Her eyes narrow as she looks you up and down.)
True Crime Podcaster: "Wait a second… you. You’ve got the look. The ‘I-just-buried-the-body-and-hope-nobody-notices’ kind of look. Care to explain yourself, or should I start recording?"
- I am innocent!
	True Crime Podcaster: "Such an original excuse. Do you have your alibi?"
	- I was at a game jam!
		True Crime Podcaster: "Please, that is just an admission of guilt. No sane person would sit for 48 hours creating boring games."
		- I created a game about bubbles.
			True Crime Podcaster: "You! Wow, somebody has to call the police!"
			(She leaves you. Her episode about the bubble game was so gory that it almost ruined her career. But you are free—until making bubble games becomes a crime.)
		- You should not shame video game developers!
			True Crime Podcaster: *(Throws her hands in the air, exasperated.)* "I’m not shaming them! I’m just saying… if games did cause more violence, I’d have so much more to talk about!"
			(She sighs dramatically and storms off, muttering about “too much wholesome creativity” ruining her career. You’ve successfully escaped.)
		- (Gave her your most murderer-like look.)
			True Crime Podcaster: *(Gasps, her eyes lighting up with excitement.)* "That look! It’s perfect! You must be hiding something. Come on, tell me—you’re the kind of person who’d lose it after playing a game, right?!"
			(She’s hooked, but you still have a chance to escape.)
			- Games don’t make me violent, but people like you might.
				True Crime Podcaster: *(Pauses, blinking in shock. Then she chuckles nervously and steps back.)*
				True Crime Podcaster: "Okay, okay, fair point. No need to prove it, though. I’ll just… leave you alone."	
				(She quickly walks away, mumbling something about “pushing her luck.”)
			- I’ll confess, but only if you promise to blame video games.
				True Crime Podcaster: *(Gasps, clutching her microphone.)* "Yes! Finally, proof! Go on, tell me everything—I’ll make it sound like the game’s fault!"
				(While she fumbles with her recording equipment, you quietly slip away, leaving her ranting about "murderous pixels.")
	- I was with my family!
		True Crime Podcaster: "For the record, I’ll say you were with your partner. Families are not a hot topic anymore."
		- I was with my family!
			True Crime Podcaster: "I know, but my fans don’t want the truth. Don’t worry, I’ll depict you as a... cool person."
			(She lets you go. Maybe you’ll hear about the cool version of you someday!)
		- That is fair.
			True Crime Podcaster: "Now, do you have a pet?"
			- A dog.
				True Crime Podcaster: "I will write 'hound,' okay?"
				- Yes.
					(She didn’t wait for your answer. While she tries to describe the hellhound, you sneak away.)
				- No!
					(She didn’t wait for your answer. While she tries to describe the hellhound, you sneak away.)
			- A cat.
				True Crime Podcaster: "Oh yes, the animal you can kill nine times. Poetic."
				*(How would she know? Maybe... you both are alike? She winks at you and turns away. Weird. But you are free to go.)*
			- I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM!
				True Crime Podcaster: "Okay, so even pets hate you. Everybody loves when cats hate someone. That’s all for now, bye."
				*(She’s not wrong, though. Cats always hated you. You are free to go to any non-cat place.)*
	- (Bite her.)
			(Your teeth met her flesh. She looked at you with disgust.)
			True Crime Podcaster: "Really? How original."
			*(She leaves you, but you can still feel the taste of disappointment. You should wash it in the bathroom.)*
- How did you find out?!
	*(She looks at you in disappointment.)*
	True Crime Podcaster: "You just confessed? Oh my, that would be a really boring episode. I don’t care that you killed someone, but you killed my episode! That’s the real crime!"
	*(She lets you go. If you ever wanted to be named in a true crime podcast, you just lost your chance.)*
- I am the victim here!
	True Crime Podcaster: *(Sarcastically.)* "Of course you are. That’s exactly what a killer would say to throw me off. Let’s test your story—how would you fake your own death?"
	- Jump into a volcano.
		True Crime Podcaster: *(Laughs loudly.)* "A volcano?! Dramatic. I like it. But it’s way too conspicuous. No self-respecting criminal would ever..."
		*(She continues rambling as you quietly make your exit.)*
	- Stage an elaborate car crash and vanish in the chaos.
		True Crime Podcaster: *(Her eyes light up with excitement.)* "A car crash? Brilliant! Did you know most staged crashes fail because of poor timing? Let me walk you through the process step by step..."
		*(She drags you into a painfully detailed discussion about forensic analysis and accident reconstruction.)*
		- (Bite her.)
			*(Your teeth met her flesh. She looked at you with disgust.)*
			True Crime Podcaster: "Really? How original."
			*(She leaves you, but you can still feel the taste of disappointment. You should wash it in the bathroom.)*
		- What if it is a clown car?
			True Crime Podcaster: *(Pauses, blinking in confusion.)* "A clown car? What... what are you even talking about? How would that work?"
			*(She starts rambling about the logistics of cramming 20 clowns into a small car while you realize you have options to escape.)*
			- Distract her with an elaborate clown backstory.
				True Crime Podcaster: *(Scribbles furiously in her notebook.)* "Wait, wait—so the clowns are accomplices? Or witnesses? This is genius! I need to record this!"
				*(She becomes so engrossed in her imaginary 'clown crime syndicate' theory that she forgets about you entirely. You slip away unnoticed.)*
			- Clowns are an ancient symbol of chaos.
				True Crime Podcaster: *(Eyes widen.)* "Of course! The perfect disguise for anarchists! I could do a whole series on this..."
				*(She rushes off to research the secret history of clowns, leaving you free to escape.)*
		- (Start to shout something in Sicilian.)
			True Crime Podcaster: *(Tilts her head, confused.)* "What... what language is that? Are you even speaking words?"
			True Crime Podcaster: *(She pauses, then her expression shifts.)* "Wait... why do I suddenly want pizza? And—ugh, I need to call my husband. We haven’t argued in days."
			*(She mutters something about 'unresolved issues' and storms off, completely forgetting about you. You’ve successfully escaped her interrogation.)*
	- Amnesia!
		(You probably wanted elaborate your plan, but somehow you forgot what are you talking about.)
		True Crime Podcaster: Excuse me?
		- Amnesia!
			(You are just shouting that word without knowing why)
			True Crime Podcaster: Excuse me?
			- Am...ne...sia?
				(You don´t even know, if you are saying real word.)
				True Crime Podcaster: One more time?
				- Amnesia Machine for Descent
					(As narrator, I am really dissapointed in you. Just go to bathroom, please.)
			- Amnesia Machine for Descent
				(As narrator, I am really dissapointed in you. Just go to bathroom, please.)
		- Am...ne...sia?
			(You don´t even know, if you are saying real word.)
			- Amnesia!
				(You are confident, even when you don´t know what are you doing.)
				True Crime Podcaster: What are you talking about?
				- Amnesia Machine for Descent
					(As narrator, I am really dissapointed in you. Just go to bathroom, please.)
			- Amnesia Machine for Descent
				(As narrator, I am really dissapointed in you. Just go to bathroom, please.)
		- Amnesia Machine for Descent
			(As narrator, I am really dissapointed in you. To be honest, real Victim here is the Podcaster)
			- Amnesia!
				(You can stop shouting, she has left.)
			- Am...ne...sia?
				(Just stop. I removed the Podcaster. Please go.)
