Game Jammer: "Hello, may I talk with you about my game?"
(Oh no, not this again. He will never shut up about the biggest AAA game he tried to make at a game jam.)
- "Not really."
	Game Jammer: "Do not worry, it will not take much of your precious time, see..."
	(Damn, he will not stop until he explains why he was not able to deliver his MMO in 48 hours!)
	- "It is not your fault!"
		Game Jammer: (His eyes widen, brimming with emotion.) "Really? You mean that? Nobody has ever said that before!"
		(He suddenly grabs his phone and starts dialing.)
		Game Jammer: "I need to call my dad and tell him everything’s okay now."
		(You use the opportunity to slip away. Escape successful.)
	- "Your game is trash!"
		Game Jammer: (Gasps dramatically.) "Trash?! Trash?! Nobody appreciates my work! You probably didn’t even try it, did you?"
		(He starts pacing back and forth, clearly offended.)
		- "I didn’t mean trash, I meant... art!"
			Game Jammer: (Stops mid-step, his eyes gleaming.) "Art? Really? Oh, you get it. Finally, someone understands me!"
			(Game Jammer begins to wax poetic about game development, giving you just enough time to sneak away.)
		- "It’s trash. Deal with it."
			Game Jammer: (Gasps even louder, dramatically falling to his knees.) "How could you?! You’re just like them! The publishers who rejected me!"
			(While he’s busy spiraling into self-pity, you quietly make your escape.)
		- "Actually, I didn’t play it."
			Game Jammer: (Pauses, staring at you in disbelief.) "You didn’t even try it?! Then how can you judge it?!"
			(He starts ranting about how "nobody understands real visionaries," giving you time to vanish into the crowd.)
	- "You could use more microtransactions!"
		Game Jammer: "Oh yes! The secret recipe for game success! Great idea!"
		(When he gives his first example of a microtransaction, a wild crowd of players storms in and beats him up. You escape during the chaos.)
	- "I think you need therapy."
		Game Jammer: (Freezes, staring at you in horror.) "Therapy? Therapy?! I’m not the problem here—you are!"
		(He launches into a tirade about how society stifles creativity. You’re trapped listening, but maybe you can steer the conversation...)
		- "You’re right, society is the worst!"
			Game Jammer: (Nods furiously.) "Exactly! Finally, someone who gets it! Let me tell you about my next game idea..."
			(He starts ranting about his new concept, which gives you an opening to slip away unnoticed.)
		- "Actually, I was kidding. You really do need therapy."
			Game Jammer: (Gasps, clutching his chest.) "You’re cruel... but maybe you’re right."
			(He sighs dramatically and walks away, leaving you free at last.)
		- "No, seriously. Get help."
			Game Jammer: (Pauses, looking thoughtful.) "Huh. Maybe I should... but would my therapist appreciate my bubble game?"
			(While he’s lost in thought, you slip away successfully.)
- "You made the game about bubbles!"
	Game Jammer: (Gasps, his face lighting up.) "You... you are the one! The one who downloaded my game!"
	(He faints from excitement, giving you a chance to escape. Well, not exactly a fan—you were just bored and scrolling OnlyFans when you stumbled upon his bubble game.)
	- "Your game was... okay."
		Game Jammer: (Recovers instantly, his enthusiasm doubling.) "Okay?! No! It was *incredible*! Let me explain the mechanics."
		(He pulls out a whiteboard he somehow brought to the party. You’re stuck.)
		- "Actually, I didn’t play it."
			Game Jammer: (Gasps again.) "Then why would you even bring it up?! Unbelievable!"
			(He spirals into a rant about fake gamers. You manage to sneak away while he’s distracted.)
		- "Fine, it was great!"
			Game Jammer: (Pauses, his expression softening.) "You really mean that? Thank you."
			(He gives you a heartfelt nod and walks away, leaving you pleasantly surprised at your successful escape.)
		- "It inspired me to uninstall all my apps."
			Game Jammer: (Pauses, frowning slightly.) "Wait... that’s not a compliment, is it?"
			(You quickly dart away while he tries to process your sarcasm.)
	- "It was awful. I uninstalled it, then deleted download file, then destroyed my computer.."
		Game Jammer: (Freezes, visibly devastated.) "Uninstalled? How could you?!"
		(He starts muttering to himself, pulling out a notebook to jot down "improvements." You take the opportunity to disappear.)
	- "I want to collaborate on your next game."
		Game Jammer: (His eyes widen with delight.) "Really? You mean that? We can change the industry together!"
		- "Yeah, totally. What’s the game about?"
			Game Jammer: "Well, it’s a roguelike MMORPG with survival horror elements and a procedurally generated microtransactions! Also... bubbles."
			(You immediately regret asking. He’s pulling out diagrams and spreadsheets now.)
			- "What if we just focused on bubbles?"
				Game Jammer: (Stops mid-ramble, his eyes narrowing.) "What do you mean, just bubbles?"
				- "Bubbles are underrated."
					Game Jammer: "Hmm... you might be onto something. A minimalist masterpiece! Thank you for the idea!"
					(He runs off to jot down notes, leaving you free to escape.)
				- "Bubbles and NFTs!"
					Game Jammer: (Gasps, his enthusiasm doubling.) "Yes! NFTs! A bubble economy—literally!"
					(As he starts ranting about blockchain integration, you take the chance to disappear.)
			- "Never mind. I have to go."
				Game Jammer: "Go?! But we haven’t even started brainstorming DLCs yet!"
				(He looks heartbroken as he tries to block your path. His soft gamer hands could not stop you.)
		- "Yes, go to garage and wait for me!."
			Game Jammer: (He starts jumping with exitement.) "Oh my god, yes, yes!!!"
			(He started to run away, but after five second he felt to groun with exhaustion. He is more numb than his gameplay.)
- "I slept with your mother!"
	Game Jammer: (Freezes, blinking in disbelief.) "What?! My... my mom?"
	(He starts laughing nervously, clearly unsure how to respond.)
	- "Yeah. She said your game was trash too."
		Game Jammer: (Gasps, then bursts into tears.) "No! Even my mom?!"
		(He collapses into a chair, utterly defeated. You slip away in the chaos.)
	- "No, I meant I slept with someone else’s mom."
		Game Jammer: (Sighs in relief.) "Oh, good. Wait, what?! That’s still weird!"
		(He’s so confused that he stops talking altogether, giving you a chance to escape.)
